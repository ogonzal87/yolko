            Yolko is an interactive graphical representation of any presentationâ€™s mood in real time. If you want to know what your audience is <strong>really</strong> feeling and/or thinking, just ask <strong>"Yolko, how are you feeling?"</strong>.

          <p>
            Yolko is powered by state of the art technologies giving you <strong>real time</strong> feedback on topics you are covering. It also tells you how you are doing throughout the presentation and whether or not you are doing a good job communicating.

            Yolko is a must for classrooms as he lets measures the level of stress while covering your subject. This let's you adjust the presentation to their needs therefore improving their performance. You can even keep track of questions anonymously from the audience. <strong>No more blank stares whenever you ask the cliche "So class; do we have any questions..?"</strong>
