#YOLKO


##Overview

All presentation and lectures are a one-directional interaction. 
I wanted to change that so that the presenter and audience could provide feedback in realtime based on the subject being presented. 
So, I created Yolko. Yolko is a real time application using **AngularJS and Firebase** that displays the mood at a presentation or lecture in a fun and interactive way.

Yolko was developed by me in a one week sprint while a student at General Assembly - Atlanta.
