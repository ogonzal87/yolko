#YOLKO


##Overview

All presentation and lectures are a one-directional interaction. 
I wanted to change that so that the presenter and audience could provide feedback in realtime based on the subject being presented. 
So, I created Yolko. Yolko is a real time application using **AngularJS and Firebase** that displays the mood at a presentation or lecture in a fun and interactive way.

Yolko was developed by me in a one week sprint while a student at General Assembly - Atlanta.

##How to use Yolko
Yolko has two views; one for the attendees and one for the presenter. 
To test Yolko just launch <a href="https://imyolko.firebaseapp.com/">the project</a>. You can also open multiple tabs to simulate multiple attendees. 
Make sure you also go to this URL (https://imyolko.firebaseapp.com/#/results.) This is the presenter view or dashboard and is hidden from the attendees. 
Anything that happens in the attendees views will be reflected in the presenter view or dashboard in REAL TIME. Check it out! Is pretty cool.
